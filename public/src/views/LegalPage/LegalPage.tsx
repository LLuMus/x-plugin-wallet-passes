                  The personal information we collect is stored and processed in
                  United States, or where we or our partners, affiliates and
                  third-party providers maintain facilities. By providing us
                  with your personal information, you consent to the disclosure
                  to these overseas third parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We will ensure that any transfer of personal information from
                  countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries
                  outside the EEA will be protected by appropriate safeguards,
                  for example by using standard data protection clauses approved
                  by the European Commission, or the use of binding corporate
                  rules or other legally accepted means.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Where we transfer personal information from a non-EEA country
                  to another country, you acknowledge that third parties in
                  other jurisdictions may not be subject to similar data
                  protection laws to the ones in our jurisdiction. There are
                  risks if any such third party engages in any act or practice
                  that would contravene the data privacy laws in our
                  jurisdiction and this might mean that you will not be able to
                  seek redress under our jurisdiction’s privacy laws.
                </p>

                  us, that you have your parent or legal guardian’s permission

                  guardian) have consented to you providing us with your
                  personal information. You do not have to provide personal
                  information to us, however, if you do not, it may affect your
                  use of this website or the products and/or services offered on

                <p>
                  We use “cookies” to collect information about you and your
                  activity across our site. A cookie is a small piece of data
                  that our website stores on your computer, and accesses each
                  time you visit, so we can understand how you use our site.
                  This helps us serve you content based on preferences you have
                  specified. Please refer to our Cookie Policy for more

                <h3>8. Business transfers</h3>
                <p>
                  If we or our assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event
                  that we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, we would
                  include data among the assets transferred to any parties who
                  acquire us. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and
                  that any parties who acquire us may continue to use your
                  personal information according to this policy.
                </p>
                <h3>9. Limits of our policy</h3>
                <p>
                  Our website may link to external sites that are not operated
                  by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the
                  content and policies of those sites, and cannot accept
                  responsibility or liability for their respective privacy
                  practices.
                </p>
                <h3>10. Changes to this policy</h3>
                <p>
                  At our discretion, we may change our privacy policy to reflect
                  current acceptable practices. We will take reasonable steps to
                  let users know about changes via our website. Your continued
                  use of this site after any changes to this policy will be
                  regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and
                  personal information.{' '}
                </p>
                <p>
                  If we make a significant change to this privacy policy, for
                  example changing a lawful basis on which we process your
                  personal information, we will ask you to re-consent to the
                  amended privacy policy.

                <h3>What is a cookie?</h3>
                <p>
                  A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on
                  your device when you visit, typically containing information
                  about the website itself, a unique identifier that allows the
                  site to recognize your web browser when you return, additional
                  data that serves the purpose of the cookie, and the lifespan
                  of the cookie itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cookies are used to enable certain features (eg. logging in),
                  to track site usage (eg. analytics), to store your user
                  settings (eg. timezone, notification preferences), and to
                  personalize your content (eg. advertising, language).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cookies set by the website you are visiting are normally
                  referred to as “first-party cookies”, and typically only track
                  your activity on that particular site. Cookies set by other
                  sites and companies (ie. third parties) are called
                  “third-party cookies”, and can be used to track you on other
                  websites that use the same third-party service.
                </p>
                <h3>Types of cookies and how we use them</h3>
                <h4>Essential cookies</h4>
                <p>
                  Essential cookies are crucial to your experience of a website,
                  enabling core features like user logins, account management,
                  shopping carts and payment processing. We use essential
                  cookies to enable certain functions on our website.
                </p>
                <h4>Performance cookies</h4>
                <p>
                  Performance cookies are used in the tracking of how you use a
                  website during your visit, without collecting personal
                  information about you. Typically, this information is
                  anonymous and aggregated with information tracked across all
                  site users, to help companies understand visitor usage
                  patterns, identify and diagnose problems or errors their users
                  may encounter, and make better strategic decisions in
                  improving their audience’s overall website experience. These
                  cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting
                  (first-party) or by third-party services. We use performance
                  cookies on our site.
                </p>
                <h4>Functionality cookies</h4>
                <p>
                  Functionality cookies are used in collecting information about
                  your device and any settings you may configure on the website
                  you’re visiting (like language and time zone settings). With
                  this information, websites can provide you with customized,
                  enhanced or optimized content and services. These cookies may
                  be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or by
                  third-party service. We use functionality cookies for selected
                  features on our site.
                </p>
                <h4>Targeting/advertising cookies</h4>
                <p>
                  Targeting/advertising cookies are used in determining what
                  promotional content is more relevant and appropriate to you
                  and your interests. Websites may use them to deliver targeted
                  advertising or to limit the number of times you see an
                  advertisement. This helps companies improve the effectiveness
                  of their campaigns and the quality of content presented to
                  you. These cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting
                  (first-party) or by third-party services.
                  Targeting/advertising cookies set by third-parties may be used
                  to track you on other websites that use the same third-party
                  service. We do not use this type of cookie on our site.
                </p>
                <h3>Third-party cookies on our site</h3>
                <p>
                  We may employ third-party companies and individuals on our
                  websites—for example, analytics providers and content
                  partners. We grant these third parties access to selected
                  information to perform specific tasks on our behalf. They may
                  also set third-party cookies in order to deliver the services
                  they are providing. Third-party cookies can be used to track
                  you on other websites that use the same third-party service.
                  As we have no control over third-party cookies, they are not
                  covered by Wallet Passes cookie policy.
                </p>
                <h4>Our third-party privacy promise</h4>
                <p>
                  We review the privacy policies of all our third-party
                  providers before enlisting their services to ensure their
                  practices align with ours. We will never knowingly include
                  third-party services that compromise or violate the privacy of
                  our users.
                </p>
                <h3>How you can control or opt out of cookies</h3>
                <p>
                  If you do not wish to accept cookies from us, you can instruct
                  your browser to refuse cookies from our website. Most browsers
                  are configured to accept cookies by default, but you can
                  update these settings to either refuse cookies altogether, or
                  to notify you when a website is trying to set or update a
                  cookie.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you browse websites from multiple devices, you may need to
                  update your settings on each individual device.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although some cookies can be blocked with little impact on
                  your experience of a website, blocking all cookies may mean
                  you are unable to access certain features and content across
                  the sites you visit.
